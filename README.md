## Getting Started
This Project is implemented by Dr. Abdalla Moustafa as a Tech. Task for NXT

The following steps were applied:

1- Implementing the whole design.

2-  fetch data from the API, parsing it, making a model for the response. (we used https://app.quicktype.io/)

-- This is actually all of what I could do due to special time lack due too many deliveries at the same time of the task.
Since I delayed the date once, so I couldn't delay it more.

-- I will prefer to have a technical meeting to discuss every thing including what I did, and what I can do too.
